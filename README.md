# SteamBuddyProject
This project has become big enough to have its own repo now

Building a system to filter steam game sales data in a better way than the store page. Also storing my data independantly of Steam. 

Using this project to learn Docker, networking, proxies, CORS, Postgres, NodeJS, Express, multithreading and maybe some React for front end stuff if I get there.
